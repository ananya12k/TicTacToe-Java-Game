# TicTacToe-Java-Game

This is a simple game of TIC TAC TOE.
I have used Java AWT and Swing to make the UI of the game.
Further ahead I plan to make it into a complete working game along with a feature of playing with computer in which I plan to use minimax algorithm to give all possible permutations that can happen inorder to make it capable to predict or counter the moves made by a user.<br>
Here's how the UI looks like:
